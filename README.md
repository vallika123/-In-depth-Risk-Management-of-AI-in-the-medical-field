The research focuses on identifying the risks present at every stage of detecting illness through image inputs using classification models. 

The study explores key aspects such as hazard scenarios, causes, propagation and escalation, consequences, and risk estimation. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted, utilizing techniques like Bayesian Belief Networks and Human Error Analysis. Additional topics covered include risk calculations, defining and reducing acceptable risk, layers of protection, reducing failure probability, and reliability. The research also addresses the process of building an AI model, AI aging, validation and verification, ongoing monitoring, and adherence to standards.
